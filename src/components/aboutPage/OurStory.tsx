                <p className="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-1.5">At Talkteon, our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea:
                    to revolutionize the way people consume and engage with news.
                    Founded in 2024, our story is one of passion, innovation,and a commitment to
                    fostering an informed global community.

                <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 mb-5">
                The idea sparked when our founder, Bolaji akusuhola, 
                recognized the need for a platform that not only delivers vreaking news but also
                cultivates a space for meaningful conversations around the stories that matter.
                With a vision to bridge the gap between news consumers and the information they seek,
                Newsteon was born.
